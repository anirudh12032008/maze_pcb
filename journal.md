## July 24 - Created the schematic and started the basic pcb
So first I started brain storming because I wanted something different from a normal hacker card and then I rememberd in khatro ke khiladi there was this maze type thing where you dont have to touch the corner and cross so I though that this is a fun idea but there were so many issue I didnt knew how to expose copper and then I asked for help in slack but got no response so I slept

## July 22 - Completed PCB and BOM
so I found that with solder mask you can expose the copper so I started working on it and yoo I created the maze added routing and its even a single layered pcb!!!! it was pretty fun creating it and then got on to BOM, the pcb has a flat charge of 799 inr but my pcb is already done so I wouldn't make it bigger now
